1.	What is Linux Operating System (OS)? List three pros and cons of it.

Ans :- It is a free and open source operating system based on the linux
And it can share charcterstices with the original unix  system

Pros:-
•	Change almost everthing about how the system looks
•	Source code is openly available
•	It is permission based system,less vulnerable to viruses

Cons:-
•	Not a beginner friendly,it is difficult to understand
•	Without proper drivers ,device may not be work.
•	Commercial applications are not officially available,available  in unofficaially only.



2.	 Differentiate between Linux, Mac, Android, and Windows OS with at least six unique features.

Ans:- 	 Linux :-
•	It is good for servers,coding etc…
•	It have a commercial software limatations like MS office,AutoCAD,etc
•	It can be modify and distrubt the source code is freely available.
•	Can use alternative like virtual machine
•	Not good for gamers,designers,etc….
•	Servers and embedded devices it is the best choice

Mac:-
•	It is developer toolbox , powerful but it requires skill
•	Built on a UNIX kernel
•	It cannot be modified and distrubt the source code because it is controlled by apple and Microsoft
•	Exclusive hardware runs only in apple devices like MacBook,etc
•	Strict app store policies
•	Stable and developer friendly

Android :-
•	It is particularly designed for smartphones,tablets from various manufactures because hardware support
•	It is also closed -source code developed by google hence it cannot be modified and distrubt
•	It is designed for user-friendly mobile experience
•	It allow access vast library of applications from google play store
•	World most usable mobile OS
•	It designed for touchscreens, simple graphical interface,etc



Windows :-
•	It is also closed-source code developed by Microsoft hence it cannot be modified and distrubt
•	It made for user-friendly with little technical knowlodge
•	Used in everywhere,  particularly in offices and gaming
•	Supporting a wide range of devices
•	Particularly designed for personal computers, laptops,etc
•	Strict control on system behaviour and appearance


3.	Why is Linux preferred for Mainframe Servers for legacy application? Give three out-of-the-box technical reasons. 
Ans:- 
•	It has a high stability and reliability ,its robust security architecture that can handle complex permission structures that essential for legacy software
•	Enchanced security and access control, it have multiple granular  permission and multiple authentication methods and it prevents the unauthorized changes or breaches
•	Its flexibility and customizability, ability to run on wide range of hardware, including older systems that also provide compatibility and functionality for older software


4.	Explain the structure of the Linux File System with proper diagram. Note: you can use the tree command to find it out.

Ans:- Diagram representation of file system tree
    /
├── bin
├── boot
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
├── lib
├── lib64
├── media
├── mnt
├── opt
├── proc
├── root
├── run
├── sbin
├── srv
├── tmp
├── usr
└── var
•	Directories in linux

•	/ - starting point of the file system 
•	/root – the home directory for the root user
•	/tmp – temporary files created by users and applications
•	/lib – stores essential shared libraries required by programs
•	/opt – third party software packages
•	/run – stores volatile runtime data
•	/srv – holds data for services provided by the system
•	/dev – shows device flows
•	/var- variable data



5.	If Linux OS is open-source, how do companies like Red Hat still making money from it? Do a market study and answer properly.
Ans : -  
•	 companies making money by selling services,not by the software itself and also give with safe and tested version of linux 
•	companies they want a secure,reliable,and supported linux
•	Red hat earns money by subscriptions,training ,consulting,cloud         partnership 
•	Demand raising on hybrid IT,DevOps and secure system 
•	market is growing is fast estimately $100 billion by 2032


6.	Write the command to display today’s date and time (i.e., current System time). 
Ans:- date,time/T


7.	Which command is used to check how long the system has been running? 
Ans:- uptime

8.	What is the difference between shutdown -h now and halt? 

Ans:-   shutdown -h now  -- attempts to power off the machine after
Halt – typically stops the CPU and leaves the system on


9.	Compare init 0 and shutdown -h. Which is safer? Why? 

Ans:-  shutdown -h safer than the init 0 because -h perform a more complete shutdown process by terminating all running process it execute in more gracefully and prepare the system for safe power off
Init 0 not safe because it performs lower level operations and leads to data inconsistencies or corruption

10. A system administrator accidentally powers off a Server machine without shutting it down properly. What problems can occur to the said Server? 

Ans:-  
•	file system corruption like data in RAM may not be written to disk 
•	unsaved  and in progress database transactions may be wasted out
•	they may be critical to restart correctly after reboot
•	sudden power off cause stress to hard disk
•	without proper shutdown lead to crashed files,lost data,etc
